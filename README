## Bash scripts

Although the simple scripts listed in this section are ready for use,
they are really meant to help you to write your own scripts.
So you can personalize F3 to your specific needs.

f3write.h2w	- Script to create files exactly like H2testw.
		  Use example: 'f3write.h2w /media/5EBD-5C80/'

log-f3wr	- Script that runs f3write and f3read, and records
		  their output into a log file.
		  Use example: 'log-f3wr log-filename /media/5EBD-5C80/'

Please notice that all scripts and use examples above assume that
f3write, f3read, and the scripts are reachable from
your environment PATH variable.
If that is not the case, but all of them are in your current path,
prefix the use examples above with 'PATH=$PATH:./' as shown below
for the script log-f3wr:

PATH=$PATH:./ log-f3wr log-filename /media/5EBD-5C80/

The current path is represented by './' in the previous example.
