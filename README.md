### Compile stable software on Linux, Apple Mac, Windows/Cygwin, and FreeBSD

make


### Compile experimental software on Linux

make experimental

NOTES:
   - Experimental software might compile on non-Linux platforms, but
     there is no guarantee given that they are only tested on Linux.
   - Please do not e-mail me saying that you want an experimental software
     to run on your platform; I already know that.
   - If you want experimental software to run on your platform,
     help to port them, or find someone that can port them for you.
     If you do port the software, please send me a patch to help others.
   - Currently, f3probe, f3brew, and f3fix are experimental.
   - f3probe and f3brew require version 1 of the library libudev to compile.
     On Ubuntu, you can install this library with the following command:
     sudo apt-get install libudev1 libudev-dev
   - f3fix requires version 0 of the library libparted to compile.
     On Ubuntu, you can install this library with the following command:
     sudo apt-get install libparted0-dev


### Use example of f3write/f3read

```
$ ./f3write /media/michel/5EBD-5C80/
$ ./f3read /media/michel/5EBD-5C80/
```

Please replace "/media/michel/5EBD-5C80/" with the appropriate path.
USB devices are mounted in "/Volumes" on Macs.

    changelog   - Change log for package maintainers

                In order to read this manual page, run `man ./f3read.1`
                To install the page, run
                `install --owner=root --group=root --mode=644 f3read.1 /usr/share/man/man1`

## Bash scripts

Although the simple scripts listed in this section are ready for use,
they are really meant to help you to write your own scripts.
So you can personalize F3 to your specific needs.

    f3write.h2w - Script to create files exactly like H2testw.
        Use example: `f3write.h2w /media/michel/5EBD-5C80/`

    log-f3wr    - Script that runs f3write and f3read, and records
                  their output into a log file.
        Use example: `log-f3wr log-filename /media/michel/5EBD-5C80/`

Please notice that all scripts and use examples above assume that
f3write, f3read, and the scripts are reachable from
your environment PATH variable.
If that is not the case, but all of them are in your current path,
prefix the use examples above with `PATH=$PATH:./` as shown below
for the script log-f3wr:

`PATH=$PATH:./ log-f3wr log-filename /media/michel/5EBD-5C80/`

The current path is represented by `./` in the previous example.

## Auto reset hardware

In order to achieve auto reseting you can build a piece of hardware following
the schematics in `hw/schematic.pdf`.

The `DTR` and `GND` have to be connected to the corresponding pins of a USB to
SERIAL/UART converter like the FTDI ones, which in turn is connected to a USB
port in your computer.

The auto reset hardware is connected to the computer using the USB B connector,
and the target USB drive is connected to it directly in the USB A connector.

Please note that f3 looks for auto reseting hardware in `/dev/ttyUSB0`, if your
device is using other device file please make a symbolic link like this:

        # ln -s /dev/ttyYOURDEVICE /dev/ttyUSB0

You can find a preview of the hardware in `hw/preview.jpg".

Once your hardware is fully connected and powered, and the target USB drive
connected to it specify the reset-type to be 2, like this:

        # f3probe --reset-type=2 /dev/TARGET
