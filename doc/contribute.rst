Help wanted
-----------

I maintain this project in my spare time, and I no longer have been able
to answer all questions and address all feedback that I receive.
Nevertheless, I still think that F3's users can stop flash
counterfeiters, but I need a little bit of help to keep moving forward.
How can you help?

-  If F3 has helped you, consider signaling this to other users staring
   F3 on GitHub. The larger the number of stars a project has, the more
   confident new users are to try it out.
-  If you know a journalist, or are one, suggest to him or her writing
   an article about fake flash. The media has not been corvering this
   subject, and having more users aware that fake flash exists will make
   counterfeiters' life harder.
-  If you own fake flash, consider donating them to me. I've been
   working on ``f3probe`` to tell in a few seconds if a flash drive is
   fake or not. I expect that ``f3probe`` will be a game changer, but I
   lack a diverse set of fake flash samples to check my hypotheses.
   Before you mail me the card, e-mail me the output you got from
   ``f3write``, ``f3read``, and (if possible) ``f3probe`` as well as the
   size the card was expected to be; I'm trying to amass a diverse set
   of fake flash, not necessarily a large number of them.
-  If you know how to use F3 well on your platform, write a blog entry
   about it, and let me know the link so I can post it on this page. You
   can also send me your name and e-mail to publish on this page as
   someone that can help other users of your platform.
-  (New) If you have a dual-boot machine with Windows and Linux, write a
   blog entry that compares h2testw, f3write/f3read, FakeFlashTest.exe,
   and f3probe. If you do this comparison, please send me the link to
   publish it on this page.
-  If you are able to test F3 on your platform, send me your name and
   e-mail, and I'll send to you a request to test new code when it is
   available on GitHub before I release it as stable to everyone. I only
   have Linux boxes, so other platforms are specially helpful.
-  If you are able to code, improve F3. I want to keep the code small to
   easily audit it, so focus on things that will either address a real
   need, for example, users' requests, or to simplify the code, or fix
   bugs, or make F3 work on a new platform, or improve the
   documentation. If you want, I can list your contact on this page as
   well, so people can reach out to you directly.
-  If you know how to code a graphic user interface, please create one
   for the platforms you can. This would increase the number of users
   that, in turn, would win ground againt the counterfeiters. I'll add a
   link to your application on this page.
-  Tell your frinds about F3, teach them how to use it, publish a video
   about F3, find ways to help me to better organize our efforts, spread
   the word, ask for your money back when you buy a fake drive, etc.

I've originally implemented F3 to address a personal need, but you have
turned it into a great tool. Let's work closer to bring it to the next
level!
